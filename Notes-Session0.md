# Into Session Notes and Next Steps
Meeting date: 6/4/2018

**First, I was great to see you all at Phoenix!**

## Next steps
Watch [lesson 1 video](https://youtu.be/IPBSB1HLNLo) and do homework before next week meetup:
* Setup environment on crestle/aws/paperspace/gcp/google collab/your computer/...
* Get comfortable with Jupyter and all other tools
* Run week1 code and understand itâ€¦Play with code to understand it
* Try different learning rates, epochs while running code
* Run code on different set of images (download from google images for example) and share results
* Feel free to explore week2 notebook

## Group communication
We will use #datascience channel at Cleveland Tech on Slack. Join Cleveland Tech on Slack with this [link](cleveland-tech.herokuapp.com/) then search for #datascience and join the channel. See you there!

## Motivation to complete the full course
Online courses platforms completion rates are pretty low. To help keep people accountable, we suggest to collect a deposit from students. You choose the amount. At the end of the program you will get all the money back. If you dropout without completing the program we count the donation as sponsorship for future CAIG meetings.

## Setup options
[There are many options to run lessons. It will depend on hardware you have, your budget, as it is recommended to use GPU for the course, althoug there is also option to use CPU only.](https://github.com/reshamas/fastai_deeplearn_part1/blob/master/README.md#platforms-for-using-fastai-gpu-required)
